Hi! I am Ruolan SUn, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Adam Charles] (https://www.bme.jhu.edu/ascharles/).
Prior to joining JHU, I received my bachelor degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology at Fudan University. From 2018 to 2020, I was advised by [Dr. Jianfeng Feng] (https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~feng/) at The Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-inspired Intelligence (https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn/lnen/).
I am interested in neural signal processing. My current projects include pre-processing complex neural data with decomposition methods, analyzing brain-wide hemodynamics of freely moving animals, and using mathematical models to analyze the statistical characteristics of neural activities.
